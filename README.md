# Front End Interview Coding Exercises

I have created this repository as an exercise for myself and others to help cement the knowledge necessary
to get a job as a React front end developer.

I have taken out 5 different interview questions I have been asked in real life to build.
Here is a rundown of the different questions

## Bitcoin API

Prerequisites

- API Url ("https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/BTC-USD/buy")
- additional metrics:
  authorization:
  "Bearer abd90df5f27a7b170cd775abf89d632b350b7c1c9d53e08b340cd9832ce52c2c",

I had to build a button that once clicked does the API call to get the latest bitcoin price
Then the consequitive clicks would set the new price to be the current price and the old price to be the previous price
I had 20 min to build this.

## Rock Paper Scissors

Prerequisites

- You are allowed to use React
- You need to finish within 45 min

Build Rock Paper Scissors from scratch.
There are 5 rounds, at the end of each round it needs to show who won.
After 5 rounds a message should appear showcasing who won the match.
With a tie nobody gets points, it is just a loss of a round.

## Star Rating

Prerequisites

- You can only use HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- You cannot run your code for testing purposes
- Build it within 30 minutes.

Build a star rating application that is modular and can be used anywhere.
When you hover on the stars they should fill in but only when you click should it saved.
As soon as you remove your mouse it should either be blank or go back to the last value captured.

## Star Wars

Prerequisites

- API URL (https://www.swapi.tech/api/people)
- finish within 20 min

Make an API call to the URL, showcase the data in a table.
The first column of the table should have some form of selection to be removed.
A button that will remove the selected rows.
The second column will be the characters name
The third and last column will be a button to get specific data about a character
that should be displayed underneath the existing table in a different table.

## Build Tic Tac Toe

Prerequisites

- You are allowed to use React
- You need to finish within 45 min

I had to build Tic Tac Toe from scratch in React.
For this exercise I had also built it in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Bigger companies such as Amazon will ask you to build these kind UI's in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I have done solutions in both React as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
